# `zsh-config`

This is a modular zsh config framework. All credit to [Andrew Brinker](https://github.com/AndrewBrinker/zsh)
for his original idea.

This is meant to be used with my main [dotfiles](https://github.com/issmirnov/dotfiles) repo, and as such certain
config has the path `~/.dotfiles` hard coded in. Feel free to fork and modify.
