## Information  

This is a medley of various dotfile management tools. oh-my-zsh is linked in as a submodule, which makes updating the config easier on me. zsh-config is another public repo that I own, forked from Andrew Brinker. 

The install script is based on @holman's work, essentially looping through the repo and linking in any files ending in ".symlink".
