# Ivan's Dotfiles

I completely agree with Anish, and thus maintain this repo for my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these are mine.

## Installation

Clone and run `./install`. This will download [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) and symlink everything into place.

## Submodules Used

- I am currently using [amix's vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc) for vim. It's super complicated, so be careful if you use it.
- The ZSH folder is what used to be a fork of [Andre Brinker's ZSH](https://github.com/AndrewBrinker/zsh) repo, and is not included directly here.
