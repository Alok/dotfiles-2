# Ivan's Dotfiles

I completely agree with Anish, and thus maintain this repo for my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these are mine.

## Installation

Clone and run `./install`. This will download [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) and symlink everything into place.

## Submodules Used

- Dotbot for installation.
- oh-my-zsh for zsh foundation.
- Vundle for vim.


## A Note about the License & Copyright:

Unless attributed otherwise, everything is under the MIT license (see LICENSE for more info).

Some stuff is not from me, and without attribution, and I no longer remember where I got it from. I apologize for that.

Feel free to copy whatever suits you, and open an issue with a question if you need some help.
