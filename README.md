This is a combination of two ideas. 'oh-my-zsh' is an entity within itself, with the .zshrc copied into zsh/zshrc.symlink, thus linking it in.
plugins are self contained

The second element is the basis of holman's work - top elevel topical directories, which either get symlinked in or sourced depending on the ending.
