=== TO DO


vimrc totally broken as well, need fixing


== Information 
This is a comnbination of two ideas. oh-my-zsh is an entity within itself, with the .zshrc copied into zsh/zshrc.symlink, thus linking it in.
plugins are self contained

The second element is the basis of holman's work - top elevel topizal directories, which either get symlinked in or sourced depending on the ending.
